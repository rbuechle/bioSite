            <h3> Rob's Story: </h3>
            <p>
                Born 25, January 1988 Robert, aka Rob, grew up in Dallas, Texas, but moved to beautiful Durango, Colorado, at the age of 12. He lived in Durango until finishing High school. Upon graduation, Rob decided to travel throughout the United States, looking for the perfect place to call home. Finally, after living in many different places and some fifteen plus moves later, he settled in Seattle, Washington.

                At an early age (he believe about 6), he was given his first computer by his grandmother. This great love for computers continued well into adulthood. In high school, he took his first-class, which taught him to build his own custom computer. After taking this class and learning the many ins and outs of building custom computers he then built his first custom gaming computer. Rob has contined to build custom machines for family and friends and has made quite a bit of money doing it for other people as well. This hobby has also helped him develop a love for coding, in turn, made him decided to go to school for computer science so that he can one day become a programmer. He would also love to develop computer games with this degree as that is a huge passion of his as well.

                Rob now resides in Lubbock, TX, with his girlfriend of 14 years and there two dogs.  He is currently in the process of finishing his Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science so that he can continue his love for coding.
