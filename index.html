            <h3> About: </h3>
            <p>
                Born 25, January 1988 Robert, aka Rob, grew up in Dallas, Texas, but moved to beautiful Durango, Colorado, at the age of 12. He lived in Durango until finishing High school.

            <h3> Early Life: </h3>
            <p> 
                At an early age (he believe about 6), he was given his first computer by his grandmother. This great love for computers continued well into adulthood. In high school, he took his first-class, which taught him to build his own custom computer. After taking this class and learning the many in’s and out of building custom computers he then built his first custom gaming computer. Rob has contined to build custom machines for family and friends and has made quite a bit of money doing it for other people as well. This hobby has also helped him develop a love for coding, in turn, made him decided to go to school for computer science so that he can one day become a programmer. He’d also love to develop computer games with this degree as that is a huge passion of his as well.
